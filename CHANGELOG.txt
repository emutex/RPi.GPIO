- Allow pydoc for non-root users (issue 27)
- Fix add_event_detect error when run as daemon (issue 32)
- Simplified exception types
- Changed from distribute to pip

0.5.2a
------
- Added software PWM (experimental)
- Added switch bounce handling to event callbacks
- Added channel number parameter to event callbacks (issue 31)
- Internal refactoring and code tidy up

0.5.1a
------
- Fixed callbacks for multiple GPIOs (issue 28)

0.5.0a
------
- Added new edge detection events (interrupt handling)
  - Added add_event_detect()
  - Added remove_event_detect()
  - Added add_event_callback()

- Removed old experimental event functions
  - Removed set_rising_event()
  - Removed set_falling_event()
  - Removed set_high_event()
  - Removed set_low_event()
- Changed event_detected() for new edge detection functionality
- input() now returns 0/LOW == False or 1/HIGH == True (integers) instead of False or True (booleans).
- Fix error on repeated import (issue 3)
- Change SetupException to a RuntimeError so it can be caught on import (issue 25, Chris Hager <chris@linuxuser.at>)

- Permit input() of channels set as outputs (Eric Ptak <trouch@trouch.com>)

0.4.0a
------
- Added support for Revision 2 boards
- Added RPI_REVISION
- Added cleanup() function and removed automatic reset functionality on program exit
- Added get_function() to read existing GPIO channel functionality (suggestion from Eric Ptak <trouch@trouch.com>)
- Added set_rising_event()
- Added set_falling_event()
- Added set_high_event()
- Added set_low_event()
- Added event_detected()
- Added test/test.py
- Converted debian to armhf
